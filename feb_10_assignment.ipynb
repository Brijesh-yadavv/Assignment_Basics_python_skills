    "# # Q2. Why close() function is used? Why is it important to close a file?\n",
    "# The close() function is used to close a file in Python.\n",
    "# Closing a file is important because it frees up system resources that were being used by the file and \n",
    "# ensures that the file's contents are saved and properly written to disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "# When you open a file in Python, the operating system allocates resources to keep track of the file and its contents. \n",
    "# If you don't close the file after you are done with it, these resources will remain in use and may cause problems later on,\n",
    "# such as running out of file handles or slowing down your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In addition, when you write to a file, the data may not be immediately written to disk. Instead, it may be stored in a buffer \n",
    "# in memory and written to disk later. Closing the file ensures that all data is properly written to disk and that the file is in a consistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For these reasons, it's important to close a file after you are done with it in Python, especially if you have written to the file.\n",
    "# You can close a file by calling the close() method on the file object, or by using the with statement, which automatically closes \n",
    "# the file for you when the block of code inside the with statement is finished."
