    "# A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for \n",

    "# A class defines the nature of an object and serves as a template for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "# An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that has state and behavior.\n",
    "# Each object is created from a class and is unique, having its own state and behavior.\n",
    "# The state of an object represents data (value) and is stored in variables,\n",
    "# while behavior represents the operations that an object can perform and is defined by methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, consider a class Person that represents a person's state (name, age, address) and behavior (introduce oneself, get older).\n",
    "# To create an object of type Person, we would create an instance of the class, specifying values for the state variables, \n",
    "# such as Person john = new Person(\"John Doe\", 30, \"123 Main St\").\n",
    "\n",
    "# In OOP, we model real-world entities as classes, and their individual instances as objects,\n",

    "\n",
    "# Abstraction: Abstraction means hiding the complexity and exposing only the essential features of an object to the user.\n",
    "# It allows the user to work with objects without having to know the underlying details of their implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of combining data and functions into a single unit or object, \n",
    "# making the data inaccessible to the outside world. \n",
    "# This protects the data from unauthorized access and modification, and helps maintain the integrity of the object's state.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties and \n",
    "# behavior from a parent class. This enables the creation of new classes based on existing ones, and supports the concept of code reusability.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.\n",
    "# This enables the implementation of generic algorithms that can work with objects of different classes,\n",
    "# as long as they implement the required interface or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Together, these four pillars form the foundation of Object-Oriented Programming and support the development of efficient,\n",
    "# flexible, and maintainable software systems."

    "It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "It provides the reusability of a code. We donâ€™t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
