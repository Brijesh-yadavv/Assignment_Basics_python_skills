    "# SQL and NoSQL are two different types of databases, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "# SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a relational database management system that is used to store and manage data in a\n",
    "# tabular format, with data organized into rows and columns. SQL databases are widely used in applications that require \n",
    "# structured data, such as financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and content management systems. SQL databases are characterized \n",
    "# by their support for transactions, strong consistency, and the ability to handle complex queries. Some popular SQL databases include\n",

    "\n",
    "# NoSQL, or \"not only SQL\", is a non-relational database management system that is used to store and manage unstructured data.\n",
    "# NoSQL databases are designed to handle large volumes of data with high availability and scalability. They are ideal for applications\n",
    "# that require fast access to large volumes of data, such as social networks, online gaming platforms, and big data applications.\n",
    "# NoSQL databases are characterized by their support for eventual consistency, high availability, and horizontal scalability. \n",

    "# Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "# In a relational database, a primary key and a foreign key are two important concepts that help establish relationships between tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table.\n",
    "# The primary key is used to enforce data integrity, ensure uniqueness, and provide a way to reference the data in the table from other tables.\n",
    "# Each table can have only one primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, consider a table called \"employees\" that has the following columns: \"employee_id\", \"name\", \"email\", and \"department_id\".\n",
    "# The \"employee_id\" column can be used as the primary key for this table, as each employee will have a unique identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "# A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table.\n",
    "# The foreign key establishes a link between the two tables, allowing data to be shared between them. \n",
    "# A foreign key constraint ensures that data in the referencing table (also known as the child table)\n",
    "# must match data in the referenced table (also known as the parent table).\n",
    "\n",
    "# For example, consider a table called \"departments\" that has the following columns: \"department_id\" and \"name\". \n",
    "# If we add a column \"department_id\" to the \"employees\" table, we can use it as a foreign key to link the \"employees\" table\n",
    "# to the \"departments\" table. This allows us to create a one-to-many relationship between the two tables, \n",
    "# where each employee belongs to one department, and each department can have many employees.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the \"department_id\" column of the \"employees\" table must\n",
    "# match the values in the \"department_id\" column of the \"departments\" table. This ensures that data in the two tables \n",
    "# is consistent and prevents data from being added to the \"employees\" table that does not correspond to a valid department \n",
    "# in the \"departments\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, a primary key is a unique identifier for a row in a table, while a foreign key establishes a link\n",
    "# between two tables by referring to the primary key in another table. Together, these two concepts help establish\n",
    "# relationships between tables in a relational database.\n"
