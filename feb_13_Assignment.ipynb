    "# Q1. Explain why we have to use the Exception class while creating a Custom Exception.\n",
    "# When we create a custom exception in a programming language, it is important to inherit from the built-in Exception class.\n",
    "# Here are a few reasons why:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Consistent behavior: By inheriting from the Exception class, we ensure that our custom exception behaves consistently with other exceptions\n",
    "# in the language.\n",
    "# This means that it can be caught and handled in the same way as other exceptions, using standard exception handling techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Access to standard exception features: The Exception class provides several useful features that can be used in our custom exception,\n",
    "# such as the ability to include a custom error message and a traceback of the code leading up to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Extensibility: By using the Exception class as a base, we can further extend our custom exception to provide additional functionality, if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Standardization: It is a best practice to use the built-in Exception class as the base for our custom exception, \n",
    "# as it is a standard practice in most programming languages. This helps ensure consistency across codebases and makes it easier\n",
    "# for other developers to understand and work with our code."
