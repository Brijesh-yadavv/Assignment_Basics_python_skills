    "\n",
    "# An example of abstraction can be seen in a real-life scenario of using a car. When we drive a\n",
    "# car, we do not have to worry about the internal workings of the engine, transmission, and other mechanical parts.\n",
    "# All we need to know is how to operate the car by using the controls, such as the steering wheel, brakes, accelerator, and gear shift.\n",
    "# This concept is similar to abstraction in OOP where we can create an object for a car with the essential features \n",
    "# and methods, such as starting the engine, accelerating, and braking, and hide the implementation details of the internal mechanics.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In programming, abstraction is achieved through classes and objects, where a class defines the properties and\n",
