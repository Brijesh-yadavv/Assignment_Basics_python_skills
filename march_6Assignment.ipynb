    "# Q1. What is Statistics?\n",
    "# Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data.\n",
    "# It involves the use of various methods and techniques to gather, organize, and summarize data from a sample or population.\n",
    "# Statistics is used in a wide range of fields, such as science, economics, psychology, medicine, and social sciences.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The main goal of statistics is to make sense of data and draw meaningful conclusions from it. \n",
    "# This involves using various statistical methods and techniques to explore relationships between variables, test hypotheses,\n",
    "# and make predictions. Statistical analysis often involves the use of probability theory and mathematical models to describe\n",
    "# and understand the patterns and trends that exist within a set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# In summary, statistics is a discipline that provides tools and methods for dealing with data and making informed decisions based\n",
    "# on that data."

    "# Q2. Define the different types of statistics and give an example of when each type might be used.\n",

    "# It is used to describe and summarize data in a meaningful way. Examples of descriptive statistics include mean, median, mode,\n",
    "# range, variance, and standard deviation.\n",
    "# Example: Suppose you have a data set of 100 students' scores on a math test. You can use descriptive statistics to calculate \n",
    "# the mean score, which will tell you the average score of all students. Similarly, you can calculate the median score, \n",
    "# which will give you the middle score of all students. You can also calculate the standard deviation to see how widely spread \n",

    "\n",
    "# Inferential statistics: This type of statistics is used to make inferences or predictions about a population based on a sample. \n",
    "# It involves hypothesis testing and the use of probability theory. It is used to draw conclusions about a larger group based on a\n",
    "# smaller sample. Examples of inferential statistics include t-tests, ANOVA, regression analysis, and chi-square tests.\n",
    "# Example: Suppose you want to determine if there is a significant difference in math scores between boys and girls in a particular school.\n",
    "# You can randomly select a sample of students from the school and use inferential statistics to determine if there is a statistically \n",

    "# Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is a measure of how much the data varies from the mean. \n",
