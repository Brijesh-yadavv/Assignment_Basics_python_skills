    "1. who developed python programming language??\n",
    "=> Guido van Rossum developed the Python programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Which type of programming does python support?\n",
    "=> Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented,\n",
    "functional, procedural, and aspect-oriented programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is python case sensitive language?\n",
    "=> Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language.\n",
    "This means that the distinction between uppercase and lowercase characters is significant\n",
    "in the language, and the same identifier (variable, function name, etc.)\n",
    "can have different meanings based on its case.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. what is correct extension of python file ?\n",
    "=> The correct file extension for Python source code is \".py\". \n",
    "This extension is used to indicate that a \n",
    "file contains Python code that can be executed on a Python interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is python code compiled or interpreted?\n",
    "=> Python code is interpreted, not compiled. This means that the source code is translated into\n",
    "machine-readable code line by line, at runtime, by the Python interpreter. \n",
    "The interpreted code can be executed immediately, making the development and testing process faster,\n",
    "but also leading to slower performance compared to compiled code.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language?\n",
    "=> In Python, blocks of code are defined using indentation.\n",
    "The following are some blocks of code used in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions: defined using the def keyword and indented code within.\n",
    "Classes: defined using the class keyword and indented code within.\n",
    "Conditional statements: defined using if, elif, and else keywords and indented code within.\n",
    "Loops: defined using for and while loops and indented code within.\n",
    "Context managers: defined using with statements and indented code within.\n",
    "Comprehensions: defined using list comprehensions,\n",
    "dictionary comprehensions, and generator comprehensions.\n",
    "These are some common blocks of code in Python, but there are other constructs as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. State a character used to give single-line comments?\n",
    "=> # \n",
    "# This is a single-line comment\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?\n",
    "=> import sys\n",
    "print(sys.version)\n",
    "\n",
    "9.Python supports the creation of ananymous function at runtime using a construct called?\n",
    "=>  \"lambda function\"\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does pip stands for python?\n",
    "=> \"pip\" stands for \"Pip Installs Packages\".\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Mention a few built-in-function in python?\n",
    "=> print: used to output values to the console\n",
    "len: used to get the length of an object (such as a string, list, or tuple)\n",
    "type: used to determine the type of an object\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is the maximum possible length of an indetifier in python?\n",
    "=> 63 characters\n",
    "13. What are the benefits of using python?\n",
    "=> Python is a popular and versatile programming language with a number of benefits, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and \n",
    "straightforward syntax that is easy to learn, especially for those new to programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of tasks, including web development, scientific \n",
    "computing, data analysis, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large community: Python has a large and active community of developers and users, making it easy \n",
    "to find help, resources, and packages to extend its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-platform compatibility: Python can run on a variety of platforms, including Windows, MacOS, \n",
    "and Linux, making it a good choice for cross-platform development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Large standard library: Python comes with a large standard library that includes many modules and\n",
    "functions, making it easy to perform common tasks without having to write a lot of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamically typed: Python is a dynamically-typed language, meaning that data types are associated with \n",
    "values, not variables, making it easier to write flexible and reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Easy to integrate with other languages: Python can easily be \n",
    "integrated with other programming languages, such as C/C++,\n",
    "allowing you to use existing libraries and tools in your Python projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How is memory managed in python?\n",
    "=> In Python, memory management is handled by the Python \n",
    "memory manager and the underlying operating system.\n",
    "The Python memory manager is responsible for allocating\n",
    "memory to Python objects and data structures and freeing it when it is no longer needed.\n",
    "This is done automatically through a process known as reference counting, where the memory manager\n",
    "keeps track of the number of references to an object. \n",
    "When the reference count of an object reaches zero,\n",
    "it is automatically deallocated and the memory it was using is freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How to install python in windows and set path variable?\n",
    "=> Here are the steps to install Python on Windows and set the path variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the installation file and follow the instructions to install Python.\n",
    "Make sure to check the option to add Python to the environment \n",
    "variables so that you can use it from the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the Start menu and search for \"Environment Variables\". \n",
    "Click on \"Edit the system environment variables\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the System Properties window, click on the \"Environment Variables\" button.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Environment Variables window, scroll down to the \"System variables\"\n",
    "section and find the \"Path\" variable. Click on \"Edit\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Edit environment variable window, click on \"New\" and \n",
    "add the path to the Python installation (e.g. C:\\Python37\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "Click \"OK\" to close all windows and save the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the Command Prompt and type python to verify that the installation was \n",
    "successful and the path variable was set correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these steps, you should have successfully installed Python on your Windows machine and set\n",
    "the path variable so that you can use it from the command prompt.\n",
    "\n",
